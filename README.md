# Maxwellian_fit

Maxwellian_fit find the temperature of an energy histogram through linear regression. Regression library from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is required. To install, see [scikit-learn install](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

To run, `Maxwellian_fit.py`. To generate the corresponding `jupyter notebook`, we use [`jupytext`](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext). 

To generate a jupyter notebook from a Python script, do:

```console
jupytext Maxwellian_fit.py --to ipynb
```

One then has to delete the original Python script, which will be re-generated by Jupyter.

For `LaTeX` font rendering of `matplotlib` figures, under `Ubuntu 20.04`:

```console
$ sudo apt install dvipng texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended cm-super
```

The script is developed for the generation of plots in the following publications:
